            <p>
                In recent times, India's anti-conversion laws have sparked significant debate over their implications for individual freedoms. Here, we highlight and analyse these laws' critical issues and the challenges they pose within the framework of family law and human rights.
            </p>
            <h3>Vague Language and Overreach</h3>
            <p>
                Anti-conversion laws use broad and ambiguous terms like "allurement," "inducement," "misrepresentation," and "undue influence" leaving plenty of room for potential mischief. In addition to this, the state legislations in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand penalise mere “convincing,” treating it the same as abetting and conspiring. Due to the wide scope of what would amount to unlawful conversion, the state legislations can encompass legitimate voluntary conversions and criminalise them.
            </p>
            <h3>Burden-Shifting Provisions</h3>
            <p>
                These laws reverse the fundamental natural law principle of "innocent until proven guilty," shifting the burden on the accused individuals to prove their innocence. This presumptive guilt places an undue burden on individuals exercising their constitutional right to freedom of religion, making them vulnerable to state overreach and societal prejudice.
            </p>
            <h3>State Paternalism</h3>
            <p>
                Enhanced penalties for conversions involving minors, women, and Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) groups reflect the State’s paternalistic stance. While framed as protective measures, they perpetuate stereotypes of vulnerability and suggest that members of these groups lack agency in choosing their faith. Furthermore, such penalties disproportionately affect SC/ST individuals seeking to leave the Hindu fold. What is interesting to note is that some state legislations, by exempting re-conversions from the ambit of unlawful conversions, allow for re-entry (even if forceful or fraudulent), while heavily constraining exit from that individual’s religion.
            </p>
            <h3>Violation of International Human Rights</h3>
            <p>
                Anti-conversion laws contravene Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which guarantees the freedom to adopt, change, or renounce one's religion. General Comment 22 on Article 18 emphasizes that this freedom includes the right not to disclose one’s religious beliefs. India's obligations under international law demand the protection of individual autonomy in matters of faith, which these laws undermine.
            </p>
            <h3>Compelling Disclosure</h3>
            <p>
                In most jurisdictions, the mandatory notice and public disclosure requirements force individuals to reveal planned religious changes. This intrusion into personal privacy not only violates international human rights norms but also exposes individuals to harassment and violence at the hands of vigilante groups. Moreover, some legislations even provide for the general public to raise objections against the planned conversions of people.
            </p>
            <h3>Incentives for False Cases</h3>
            <p>
                Essentially, some state legislations create financial incentives for alleged victims and their families to file FIRs, by making the accused liable to pay hefty compensation to the alleged victims, in addition to a fine. Coupled with the wide scope of unlawful conversion, such provisions risk the initiation of false cases, further clogging the judicial system.
            </p>
            <h3>Impact on Minority Institutions</h3>
            <p>
                The laws in states like Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have provisions which would impair the functioning of institutions found in violation of anti-conversion laws, by cancelling their registration and withdrawing the state government’s financial aid, respectively. These provisions ultimately threaten the sustainability of minority religious organizations and the rights and protections accorded to these communities.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Unless the issues highlighted above are adequately addressed, the enforcement of anti-conversion laws in a communally charged majoritarian environment could lead to further harassment and criminalization of not only religious minorities but also other socially and economically disadvantaged communities.
